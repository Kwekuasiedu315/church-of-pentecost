            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>The Church of Pentecost is a global ministry with its headquarters in Accra, Ghana. The church was
                founded in
                1931 by Pastor James McKeown, an Irish missionary who was sent to Ghana by the Apostolic Church,
                Bradford,
                England. Today, the Church of Pentecost has more than 3 million members in over 100 countries around the
                world.
            </p>
            <p>Our mission is to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ to all nations, and to make disciples of all
                people. We
                believe in the power of the Holy Spirit to transform lives and communities, and we seek to be a light in
                the
                world by sharing the love of Christ with others.
